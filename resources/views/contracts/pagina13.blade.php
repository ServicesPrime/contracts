            If, due to emergencies, special occasions, Disinfection and Sanitization Services (such as those
            required during public health events like COVID-19), or other unscheduled circumstances, the
            performance of the Services requires cleaning chemicals, disinfectants, or related supplies in quantities
            beyond what is reasonably anticipated in the scope of this Agreement, the Contractor may charge the

            to the CLIENT in advance of any such anticipated overage, and an itemized statement or
            supporting documentation of the costs will be made available to the CLIENT upon request.
